Notice: I'm not hating the projects in the following areas/industries, just exposing my views on the new problems on crypto. I do think that a decentralized internet, money and storage (and more!) are the future.


- Most of defi makes no sense
- wtf is GameFi
- 99% of new bullshit is just swalled and puked other shit
- NFTs could have been


# Most of new Web3 is just garbage
When was the last time that you actually used Web3 for something useful besides just for "trading"?
This might quite obvious, but most of DeFi nowadays is just creating a reason for people to trade useless stuff, so it generates value for more useless stuff (and this recursively).



## NFTs

What is even the point of the typical NFT? Who's actually buying this garbage? They have no use besides just for trading.
Seems like it's just a game of "Who will be the last idiot to buy this and sell it on a loss"?

I'm no genius, but why ins't this so obvious?
I see people just shilling dumb shit on Twitter and Discord, going to communities just to hype up their bags. And then the creators of these projects go to conferences to explain the new shit they are going to add to their NFT project, which isn't just another money grab.

It reminds me of when I was in 1st year of school, when kids would trade their Tazos and cards for a few weeks until new popular thing would pop on television ads, where, for example, the tazos would be throwable and random stuff like that.

NFTs aren't just more than that, but for grownups and aren't even physical.



And now every artist things they are "Edgy" or "Smart" for "uploading their art to the blockchain", even though they don't even know what's that. Isn't it just uploading your stuff to Twitter or something similar?
What's the use of ToKeNizE this kind of stuff?
I understand that there should be a "Uniqueness" aspect to art, but the experience doesn't change when you are just "Experiencing" the art in a Digital way, when you could enjoy the real thing in real life (but that's another discussion).


## GameFi and AI in crypto

What?

I don't know if this comes from a specific book or culture, but what's the point of joining two tools just for the sake of joining?


I don't see what's the point of joining a Fishing Rod with an Axe. I mean, you could use it to smack the fish in the head, but besides that it's just dumb.

Same as for GameFi.
Nice, you can have your virtual items in the Blockchain, but the game won't last forever, so you are just stuck with them.

They have no value after the company goes bankrupt (which most of them will), and you bought these NFTs for a even useless purpose.


And AI. Wtf you mean you want to have on of the things that require the most speed in computation related to one of the slowest things we use?
Blockchain networks are extremely complex (in the communication and consensus sense) and are slow on purpose, where as AI requires extremely fast computation as to be executed as fast as possible.



## Tokens

Like what I've said before, this is the same, but tokens aren't fungible.
It's as if you had multiple kids creating their own coins in school, and having them trade their own coins with other kid's coins. No value is created in this.
I mean, at least the kids might have fun, unlike CryptoBros, where they get scammed, rugpulled and fall for the same game of "Who's the last idiot to buy".


## Protocols
Everyone and their mothers have created a new protocol.
What's the point of creating so many protocols if no one uses them?
Every time I heard someone saying "we created a new protocol", what they mean is that they just created a new empty ecosystem that no one is going to use.
I understand that when technology is new, these kind of things get implemented a lot. When computer networks were first created, there were multiple different protocols, and we ended up with just a few (not necessarily the best ones).
But why creating a new "DeFi Protocol" just for the sake of creating a new one? Users don't necessarily use the best software (or the best of anything), they just end up using what's most used (network effect).
Why do we need 1000 different borrowing protocols created every month?



# Dumb garbage in the crypto space is the reason we can't have nice stuff


Even though that Bitcoin was created solely for exchanging value between parties, people later found out that this can be used as a decentralized monetary incentive layer for later decentralizing more stuff. And I think that's one of the most important finds in the last 10 years.

We couldn't just create totally decentralized systems, as they would require an incentive for people to decentralize it, that is, to run the node software in their computers (and other aspects).

We finally can have decentralized storage, decentralized voting and other cool stuff, but we are focusing on quick money makers, stupid garbge.

It's sad how even the creators of such popular Blockchains, like Tezos, Solana, Fantom, etc, are focusing only in making their new shiny network popular, solely based on how fast and easy people can trade NFTs.

I actually think that there are more projects than users.

I won't say that the aspect of "NFT" isn't important, is just how people use it has made it overloaded with the idea of scams, useless monkey pics and others.

Same as for DeFi in general. Being able to replace the traditional financial system, with a fast, secure, decentralized and transparent one could have been a revolution. But I guess trading dog coins and pepe coins was the best use for it.

This will be the demise of what Web3 could be, useless and over complicated stuff than no one cares besides people looking for investments.
